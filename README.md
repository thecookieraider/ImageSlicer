# ImageSlicer
Takes any number of images and produces a new image made up of equal slices from each of the source images. 

Just a fun little project that I made in my spare time. Require the Pillow image library and Python 3.4+. Run it from the command line (ImageSlicer.py)

Images must be of the same size.

Supported and tested image formats: png, jpg, ppm
